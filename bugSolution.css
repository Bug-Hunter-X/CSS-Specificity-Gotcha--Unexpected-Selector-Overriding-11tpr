The solution to this CSS specificity problem is to increase the specificity of the `.container .item.special` selector or reduce the specificity of the `.item` selector to guarantee the intended styling.  One effective approach is to add an extra class to the container. 

```css
.container {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container .item {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}

.container.special-container .item.special {
  background-color: lightpink; /* Now correctly overrides */
}

.item {
  background-color: yellow; 
}

```

By adding the `special-container` class to the container element, the specificity of the selector targeting `.item.special` increases, making it more likely to override other styles.  This is better than trying to reduce the specificity of the `.item` selector since it might have other unintended consequences. Alternatively, you could add an `id` to the container element to create an even more specific selector.
